1
00:01:34,878 --> 00:01:37,308
All the birds of the feather

2
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:40,437
Do what they love most of all

3
00:01:41,604 --> 00:01:44,784
We are the best at rhythm and laughter

4
00:01:44,994 --> 00:01:47,287
That's why we love Carnival

5
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:51,040
All so clear we can sing to

6
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:53,961
Some adventures reborn

7
00:01:55,085 --> 00:01:57,974
Dance to the music, passion and knowledge

8
00:01:58,497 --> 00:02:00,894
Show us the best you can do

9
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:04,647
Everyone here is on fire

10
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:07,462
Get up and join in the fun

11
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:12,071
Dancing with strangers, don't mess with danger

12
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:15,195
Magic could happen for Rio

13
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,975
In Rio, all by itself (itself)

14
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,729
Your dancing and knowing

15
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,336
You can't find it anywhere else

16
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,508
Yes Rio, in Rio

17
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,843
You know something else

18
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:37,284
You can feel it happening

19
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:40,114
You can feel it all by yourself

20
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:32,011
It's okay, it's okay.

21
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:37,308
Shhh.

22
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:41,292
I'll take care of you.

23
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:18,474
Stupid clock!

24
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:33,698
Good morning Blu.

25
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:50,808
You...

26
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:52,303
Tyler Blu Gandersen.

27
00:05:52,513 --> 00:05:54,760
You know these vitamins
are good for you.

28
00:05:56,011 --> 00:05:57,929
Uuh, what's this?

29
00:05:58,764 --> 00:06:00,098
Gotcha.

30
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:18,534
Arghhh!

31
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,094
Enjoy the new book.

32
00:06:38,177 --> 00:06:39,221
Thanks Linda.

33
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:40,597
Bye now.

34
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:43,287
Yes, Mum.
I love to visit.

35
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:44,977
But who'll take care of Blu?

36
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:48,730
Mum, they don't have
candles for parrots.

37
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:51,170
Here's your hot chocolate, Blu.

38
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,318
Just how you like it.

39
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,487
Because I don't trust leaving
Blu with just anyone.

40
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:58,386
No, I don't have a bird sitter.

41
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,699
What is a bird sitter...

42
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,701
This is the life.

43
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:04,871
The perfect marshmallow
to cocoa ratio.

44
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:07,394
One, two, three,
four, five,... Six!

45
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:18,489
Well, if it isn't
my favorite nerd bird.

46
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,407
Very funny, real mature.

47
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:23,652
Hey Pet, where are you
migrating to this year?

48
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,426
The 'broad-first' nook?

49
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:28,603
Throw all the snow
balls you want.

50
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:32,315
I'm protected by this magical
force field, called "glass".

51
00:07:32,523 --> 00:07:34,874
It's what keep us so
toasty and warm in here,

52
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,777
while you guys are out
there freezing your...

53
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:41,011
Classy.

54
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:49,249
Ara-ara!
Ara-ara!

55
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,923
Are you all right?

56
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,031
I'm not really built for this weather.

57
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:04,180
Oh, are you looking for some books?

58
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:05,327
Books?

59
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:06,974
No, no.

60
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:10,665
I've come six thousand miles
looking for him.

61
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:15,336
Doctor of Ornithology?

62
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:18,131
Ooh, he's magnificent.

63
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:24,116
Linda, a little help here.
Linda!

64
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:29,976
Wow, you're actually communicating.

65
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:32,853
Yes, I introduced myself and
shook my tail feathers,

66
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:35,606
counter-clockwise,
thus referring to his dominance.

67
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:37,774
I did not get that at all.

68
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:39,569
So, Dr Monteiro.

69
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,370
No Dr. Please, just call me Tulio.

70
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,283
You know your Macaw
is a very special bird.

71
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:47,534
In fact, as far as we know,

72
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:50,058
Blu is the last male of his kind.

73
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,122
Really?
- Yes.

74
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,895
Recently we found a female.

75
00:08:53,896 --> 00:08:57,712
And our hope is to bring the two
of them together to save their species.

76
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:02,758
Well sure, when can she come over?

77
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,653
Oh, no, she is in Brazil.

78
00:09:04,654 --> 00:09:06,915
Blu must come to Rio De Janeiro.

79
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,517
Rio, Brazil?

80
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,395
Oh, no, no, no, no.

81
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,870
I never let Blu out of my sight.

82
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:17,993
He needs me.

83
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:20,223
Oh no.
You misunderstand.

84
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:23,946
It's all arranged. You'll be
with him every step of the way.

85
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:26,072
And I'll be with you.

86
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:30,035
Look, I know you're doing your job.

87
00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:32,663
But... well, Blu's very particular...

88
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,358
And we have our little routine here

89
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:37,236
and we're not big on travel.

90
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:40,045
Heck, he doesn't even fly.

91
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,628
Of course he can fly.

92
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:43,904
He's a perfect specimen.

93
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:45,092
What are you doing?

94
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:47,333
Don't worry, their natural
instincts always take over.

95
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:48,782
Wait, no!

96
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,348
Well, almost always.

97
00:09:52,432 --> 00:09:53,808
Blu!

98
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:55,821
What kind of doctor are you?

99
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:57,333
Are you okay?

100
00:09:57,374 --> 00:09:59,502
Perhaps he's too domesticated.

101
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:02,463
It was very nice of you to step in,

102
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:05,131
squawk around and throw my bird,

103
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:06,801
but now it is time for you to go.

104
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:07,989
I'm very sorry.

105
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:10,889
I'm very sorry, but wait, Linda.

106
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:13,411
This could be our last chance.

107
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:16,269
Have a safe flight.

108
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:20,710
Linda, please listen to me!

109
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:25,152
If we don't do this,
his whole species will be gone.

110
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:31,805
Just think about it.

111
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:38,957
Natural instincts.

112
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:42,545
There is nothing natural about being
thrown half way across the room.

113
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:44,130
Hah, I'll show him.

114
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:47,632
I can do this.
I just have to work out the physics.

115
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:49,806
I have quadrated my vector angles.

116
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:53,607
I have adjusted for wind shear,
house every reinforcement.

117
00:10:53,742 --> 00:10:54,911
Good.

118
00:10:55,682 --> 00:10:57,934
Okay, let's see.

119
00:10:58,038 --> 00:10:59,728
Flaps open, perfect.

120
00:10:59,936 --> 00:11:01,563
Landing gear, checked.

121
00:11:01,646 --> 00:11:04,029
Tail flaps, operational.

122
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,006
And actually, not bad.

123
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,989
This is it. Let's fly.

124
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:14,826
Just keep it simple.

125
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:17,996
Thrust, lift, drag, and wait.

126
00:11:18,163 --> 00:11:19,998
Thrust, lift, drag, wait!

127
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,374
Thrust, lift, drag, wait!

128
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,627
Thrust, lift, drag, wait!

129
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:28,964
Blu?

130
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:41,228
I promised I'll always
look out for you.

131
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:42,812
Didn't I?

132
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:49,381
Have I ever broken a promise?

133
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,843
I'm scared too.

134
00:11:54,302 --> 00:11:58,431
But I wouldn't make you do this
if it wasn't the right thing to do.

135
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,873
What do you say Blu?

136
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:11,320
That's my big brave boy.

137
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:14,927
We will be back home
before we even know it.

138
00:12:45,436 --> 00:12:48,732
Your turn Blu.
You don't want to get 'beak-burn'.

139
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:04,915
Wow, what's going on here?

140
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:07,750
You arrive in time for carnival.
- Carnival?

141
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:10,399
Yes, it's the biggest
party in the world.

142
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:13,797
You know a time to
have fun and dance.

143
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:16,801
Oh mine!

144
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:19,304
Is she a performer?

145
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:22,139
No, in fact she's my dentist.

146
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:23,911
Dr. Barbosa!

147
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,311
Do not forget to floss, Tulio.

148
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:29,396
You got it.

149
00:13:29,564 --> 00:13:32,670
Come tomorrow night,
everyone will be dressed like that.

150
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:34,464
Oh, not me.

151
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:44,181
Oh, wait.

152
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:50,251
I am not from here.

153
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:52,117
Hey Nico, he's a tourist.

154
00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:53,723
Funny, you don't look like one.

155
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,317
Really? I don't?

156
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:58,154
Except, you've got pigeon dodo
on your nose.

157
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,573
Oh, no, this is just SPF3000.

158
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:02,262
So, are you here for carnival?

159
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:05,328
Actually I'm just here to meet a girl.

160
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:06,912
Huh, a girl?
- Yes.

161
00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:09,708
Little word of advice.
You make the first move.

162
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,794
Brazilian women respond to confidence.
- Oh, right.

163
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:14,837
Yes, it's all about swagger.

164
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,878
You've got to pop out that chest,

165
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,586
swing that tail,

166
00:14:18,796 --> 00:14:22,371
eyes narrowed look like some
kind of crazy love hawk.

167
00:14:22,804 --> 00:14:25,139
But first we've got to bust you out.
- What?

168
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:28,101
I'm gonna pop that cage
open like a soda cap.

169
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:29,789
No, no...

170
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:31,520
No, that's okay.

171
00:14:32,397 --> 00:14:34,169
You call that popping?

172
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,869
This thing's robust.

173
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,985
No, guys really, I'm fine.
The cage is great.

174
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:39,154
Love the cage.

175
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:40,884
Dabbo, suit yourself.

176
00:14:40,926 --> 00:14:43,115
Don't forget, love hawk.

177
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,224
Yes and to you as well.

178
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,928
This is the heart
and soul of our aviary.

179
00:15:05,095 --> 00:15:06,472
Our treatment room.

180
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:09,933
They really like you.

181
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,328
A lot.
- Yes!

182
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:15,272
I'm their great big mama bird.

183
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:25,304
You want some?
- No, I'm good.

184
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:29,369
Many of the birds here
were rescued from smugglers.

185
00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:31,518
Smugglers?
- Yes.

186
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:34,916
Unfortunately, the poor
birds are often hurt.

187
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:36,480
Or even killed in the process.

188
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:39,337
But with proper care,
they can be saved.

189
00:15:39,796 --> 00:15:40,672
Look here.

190
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:42,674
This poor guy was found last night.

191
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,741
Hey buddy, you're looking great today.

192
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:49,055
Much better,
much better.

193
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:52,393
Get well soon.

194
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:56,833
So, where is Jewel?

195
00:15:56,854 --> 00:15:59,086
Oh, we have a special place for Jewel.

196
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:01,213
She's a very spirited bird.

197
00:16:01,463 --> 00:16:02,965
I'll say.

198
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:04,508
She did that?

199
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:05,607
Charming.

200
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:07,573
Okay, I want to go home now.

201
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:09,367
No, don't worry.

202
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,016
I'm going to make you look irresistible.

203
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:20,607
Help! Help!
Let me out of here!

204
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,780
Linda!

205
00:16:26,863 --> 00:16:29,721
Maybe I should...
No, give it a chance.

206
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:41,273
Hello?

207
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:45,006
Hello?

208
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:49,928
I come in peace.

209
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:56,935
She's beautiful.

210
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:03,837
What were they talking about?
She's... like an angel.

211
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:10,573
An angel whose getting really close up!

212
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:18,956
You're standing on my throat.
- You're an American.

213
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:20,562
Thanks.

214
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,752
I need my throat for talking,
so thank you.

215
00:17:22,772 --> 00:17:24,233
You look like me.

216
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:26,194
Hi.

217
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:28,090
Hi. My name is Blu.

218
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:30,594
You know like the cheese
with the mould on it.

219
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:32,142
No, it smells really bad.

220
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:34,228
That's stupid, stupid, stupid.

221
00:17:34,306 --> 00:17:36,661
Alright come on,
we don't have much time.

222
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,852
Wait, wait!
Ouch!

223
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,657
Are you ready?
- For what?

224
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:54,888
Oh, oh, wow.
Aah... okay.

225
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:56,805
Confidence!

226
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,788
Crazy love hawk.

227
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:02,969
Wow, hey!
What are you doing?

228
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,742
What?
What you want me to.

229
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:07,588
But just for argument sake,
what are you doing?

230
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,987
I am trying to escape.

231
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,089
Oh..., ya... escape,

232
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,384
that's where I was going
with that thing I just did.

233
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,575
Wait, wait.

234
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:17,869
Did you actually think we were going to kiss?

235
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,620
No, no, no!
- We just met!

236
00:18:19,871 --> 00:18:23,020
Oh mine!
- I think they need a little help.

237
00:18:23,146 --> 00:18:26,044
I know how my feathers look,
but I'm not that kind of bird.

238
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:30,861
Okay, I had nothing to do with that.

239
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,364
But, it's actually a pretty good song.

240
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,994
'Naturally...' yes, sing it Lionel.

241
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,469
Wow, That was fast.

242
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:49,921
Lionel Richie. Works every time.

243
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:53,132
We should probably
give them some privacy.

244
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,392
I'm not so sure I should
leave Blu here alone.

245
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:03,925
Oh no, don't worry.

246
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,480
Sylvio will keep an eye on them all night.

247
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:12,819
Besides, he's got Jewel.

248
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,139
Help me!

249
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,982
This is the final countdown to Carnival!
Let's Samba.

250
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,785
Come here little birdie.

251
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:07,040
It's okay. I got you.

252
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,938
Excuse me!

253
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:34,921
Please, I'm trying to sleep.

254
00:20:35,046 --> 00:20:39,217
I'm sorry sleepy head,
I'm trying to escape.

255
00:20:40,677 --> 00:20:43,305
Escape, why?
This cage is awesome.

256
00:20:43,346 --> 00:20:46,724
This cage...?
Oh, what was I thinking?

257
00:20:47,058 --> 00:20:50,185
I wouldn't expect a pet to understand.

258
00:20:50,436 --> 00:20:52,730
Pet?
Did you just call me a pet?

259
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:54,858
For the record, I am not a pet.

260
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,235
I am a companion.

261
00:20:56,525 --> 00:20:57,902
And you know what?
Do what you want.

262
00:20:57,903 --> 00:20:59,885
Cause' tomorrow morning
Linda will come for me,

263
00:20:59,886 --> 00:21:01,719
and this whole nightmare will be over.

264
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,266
Incredibly, you rather be with a human

265
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:06,727
than with your own kind.

266
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,832
Well, that human has given me love
and affection for the past 15 years,

267
00:21:10,843 --> 00:21:13,970
whereas my own kind tries
to strangle me after 15 seconds.

268
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,893
Yah, it's because of them,
I've lost everything.

269
00:21:16,998 --> 00:21:18,458
You can't trust them!

270
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:21,196
Of course, you can trust humans.

271
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:23,677
Jewel?

272
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:24,992
Jewel?

273
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:27,181
Hi there!

274
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,631
It's nice of you to join me for dinner.

275
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:41,174
I often eat alone.

276
00:21:41,612 --> 00:21:43,969
Because of my work.

277
00:21:44,614 --> 00:21:47,326
I thought I was the 'bird-mad'
until I met you.

278
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,454
Yes, right.
Do you have a favorite bird?

279
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,812
Well, obviously
I'm a Blue Macaw kind of gal.

280
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:57,294
That makes sense.
They are very handsome birds.

281
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:59,775
Actually, it's the brains I'm attracted to.

282
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,403
I'm not so impressed by fancy feathers.

283
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,510
I know exactly,
what you mean.

284
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:06,491
My favorite bird is the spotted owl.

285
00:22:06,512 --> 00:22:10,189
I've always been mesmerized by those big,

286
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,005
round intelligent eyes.

287
00:22:16,229 --> 00:22:17,564
Chicken rolls?

288
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:18,921
Lambada.

289
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:21,360
Chicken eyes.

290
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,029
Oh gosh!

291
00:22:33,642 --> 00:22:34,893
Hello.

292
00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:54,788
Oh, Blu.

293
00:22:55,643 --> 00:22:58,688
We should have never left.

294
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,527
This is all my fault.
- No Linda, please.

295
00:23:03,568 --> 00:23:05,508
This is not your fault.

296
00:23:06,904 --> 00:23:10,595
You're right,
It's not my fault.

297
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,400
- It's your fault!
- What?

298
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:14,392
With your little bird talk,

299
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,852
and that whole...

300
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:18,510
Well, you know what?

301
00:23:18,511 --> 00:23:20,701
Squawk squawking is squawk-squawk!

302
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,378
I am sorry.
I didn't mean to curse.

303
00:23:23,421 --> 00:23:25,229
I don't understand!

304
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,404
Sylvio is the best guard in the business.

305
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:28,739
So let me get this straight.

306
00:23:28,781 --> 00:23:30,865
You were attacked
by a little white bird.

307
00:23:30,949 --> 00:23:35,328
Yes, with this rag he held it
to my mouth, like this.

308
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:44,567
We're doomed.

309
00:23:51,866 --> 00:23:55,473
Okay, there's no place like home,
there's no place like home.

310
00:23:55,724 --> 00:23:57,601
How I wish I was back in my cage

311
00:23:57,611 --> 00:24:00,645
with my mirror and my swing
and my little bell.

312
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,253
How I miss my little bell.
- Ssshh, play dead.

313
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:07,965
What? I don't need to play dead.
I'm about to have a heart attack.

314
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:10,697
Just do it!
- Fine.

315
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:20,436
Stop twitching.
- Come on, it’s the twitching that sells it.

316
00:24:24,544 --> 00:24:26,045
Come on in, kid.

317
00:24:33,595 --> 00:24:37,307
Well, what do you know?
Good work, Fernando.

318
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:41,999
You see boys.
What did I tell you about this one?

319
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,750
That you are going to pay him
half as much as what you said?

320
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:46,274
No, you idiot.

321
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:49,297
That he reminds me of myself
when I was that age.

322
00:24:49,505 --> 00:24:53,342
Smart, resourceful.
Here you go, kid.

323
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:57,139
Hey, it's only half of what
you promised me.

324
00:24:57,252 --> 00:24:58,515
Shut up, kid.

325
00:24:59,078 --> 00:25:00,454
What the...?

326
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,254
I thought I told you I needed
these birds alive.

327
00:25:05,543 --> 00:25:08,629
Tell me, Fernando.
Does this look alive to you?

328
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:10,151
Huh?

329
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,259
Get it!
- Over here!

330
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:15,761
Jewel!

331
00:25:24,978 --> 00:25:27,966
Hello, pretty bird.

332
00:25:28,489 --> 00:25:29,844
What's the matter?

333
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:31,305
Cockatoo got your throat?

334
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:34,270
Nigel, alive.

335
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:36,740
To be continued.

336
00:25:41,912 --> 00:25:44,748
That was your plan!
To take off and leave me!

337
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:45,999
Gee, thanks.

338
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:48,063
Why didn't you follow me?

339
00:25:50,086 --> 00:25:53,403
Nice work, Nigel.
- Yah, nice work, Nigel.

340
00:25:54,236 --> 00:25:56,134
The last two Macawsan birds.

341
00:25:57,052 --> 00:25:58,887
These are worth a fortune.

342
00:25:58,928 --> 00:26:01,786
Hey, Fernando!
Hang these up in the other room.

343
00:26:15,862 --> 00:26:18,823
Hey, birdie.
Let me out! Let me out!

344
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:20,012
Let me out of here!

345
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:23,369
Pretty bird. I'm a pretty bird.
Pretty bird. I'm a pretty bird, hahaha!

346
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:26,174
I was framed.
They got the wrong guy.

347
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:28,876
Sorry guys.
Nothing personal.

348
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:41,221
So, what is going to happen to them?

349
00:26:41,262 --> 00:26:44,766
Don't worry.
We're going to find good homes for them.

350
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:46,788
Now go home to Mama.

351
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,145
But I don't have a Mama.
Father?

352
00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:51,147
Brother?
Gold fish?

353
00:26:51,856 --> 00:26:53,649
Can we keep him, boss?

354
00:26:55,129 --> 00:26:56,110
No!

355
00:26:57,341 --> 00:27:00,198
So Marcel, what's really going
to happen to those birds?

356
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:02,784
Dulled, plucked, stuffed, eaten, who cares.

357
00:27:02,866 --> 00:27:05,223
All I know is,
we are going to be rich.

358
00:27:06,621 --> 00:27:08,727
We're gonna to be rich.

359
00:27:56,336 --> 00:27:58,359
Come on, the game's starting.

360
00:27:58,578 --> 00:28:01,779
Yes, you be very clear.
Tomorrow or the deal is off.

361
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,532
Of course, I have both the Macaws.

362
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,784
Yes, I'll deliver them myself.

363
00:28:06,995 --> 00:28:08,452
Au revoir.

364
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:12,393
Alright you two,
we load the truck tonight.

365
00:28:12,518 --> 00:28:15,397
First thing in the morning,
we bring those birds to the airport.

366
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:18,274
You got it?
- Yeah, sure, heard you.

367
00:28:18,462 --> 00:28:21,236
And one of you, feed Nigel.

368
00:28:27,888 --> 00:28:30,015
Rock paper scissors, shoot.

369
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:30,725
Yes!

370
00:28:30,766 --> 00:28:33,508
No-no, scissors cut rock.

371
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:35,802
Oh man, how come you always win?

372
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,360
Nice birdie.

373
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:46,615
Here you go.

374
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:56,374
Ughh, cannibal.

375
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:00,879
Okay, hold it together.
The key is not to panic.

376
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,948
I'm not panicking.

377
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:04,070
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to me.

378
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:06,968
But it's okay.
Any minute now, Linda will find us.

379
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:10,456
Oh great, and then she'll just stick us
behind another set of bars, right?

380
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,843
Yes, I mean No!

381
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:16,082
Look, pet cages might work for you
but I don't want to belong to anyone.

382
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:27,592
Something seems to be lodged in my beak.

383
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:29,698
Would you mind?

384
00:29:43,483 --> 00:29:46,102
Oh, I know I'm not a pretty birdie.

385
00:29:46,103 --> 00:29:48,979
But I used to be quite a looker.

386
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,511
The star.

387
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:55,516
Lights, camera, action.

388
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:57,832
I was striking svelte.

389
00:29:57,852 --> 00:30:00,083
Ambitious feet-to-beak.

390
00:30:00,094 --> 00:30:01,387
So birdie-licious.

391
00:30:01,397 --> 00:30:04,280
Now I'm vile.
I'm villain and vicious.

392
00:30:04,295 --> 00:30:06,025
Oh, and malicious.

393
00:30:06,027 --> 00:30:08,697
I had it all, tv shows, women too.

394
00:30:08,738 --> 00:30:11,448
I was tall. Over 1'foot 2".

395
00:30:11,469 --> 00:30:14,034
Then they got a pretty
parrot to fill my shoes.

396
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:16,307
That's why I am so evil,
why I do what I do.

397
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,113
He was a superstar.
So young and vital.

398
00:30:19,134 --> 00:30:21,584
He's nasty.
A Southern American idol.

399
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:24,169
He's a vicious bird.
Who said that about me?

400
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:26,881
A very vicious bird.
I'll have you rotisseried.

401
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:29,962
I am a feathery freak with beak,
a bird murderer.

402
00:30:29,984 --> 00:30:32,678
You think you're better than me.
I've never heard of you.

403
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:35,285
I'm evil. I'll feed your
cheese balls with weevils.

404
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:38,476
I poop on people
and I blame it on seagulls.

405
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:39,826
It was him.

406
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:42,251
He's a nasty bird,
I'm invincible.

407
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:43,582
He's ghastly.

408
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:47,597
I'm invincible, I'm unwashable, unrinsible.

409
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:50,039
Like an abandoned school, I have no principles.

410
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:52,345
All of you Brazilian birds

411
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:54,870
All 18 million birds.

412
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:57,394
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

413
00:30:57,395 --> 00:31:00,089
I'm going to make you...

414
00:31:00,414 --> 00:31:02,145
Shut up now, shut up!

415
00:31:03,271 --> 00:31:04,439
Just me.

416
00:31:04,688 --> 00:31:10,361
I will make you ugly too.

417
00:31:10,737 --> 00:31:13,135
Hey!
- Sweet nightmares.

418
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:18,953
Not cool man.
Scary, but not cool!

419
00:31:19,495 --> 00:31:21,407
Hey, are you okay?
- No.

420
00:31:21,414 --> 00:31:23,708
I'm definitely not okay!

421
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,126
What are you doing?
- Getting out of here.

422
00:31:26,377 --> 00:31:27,957
You going to help me, or what?

423
00:31:27,962 --> 00:31:31,841
Actually our survival guide said
to sit and wait, and help will come.

424
00:31:31,883 --> 00:31:33,336
No one is coming!

425
00:31:33,342 --> 00:31:37,367
We are on our own and if we just
sit here, we're going to die!

426
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:41,683
Yes, yes, yes.

427
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:43,144
No!

428
00:31:43,395 --> 00:31:45,438
Nigel, get out of the way!

429
00:31:48,232 --> 00:31:51,026
Stop, stop.
Why don't you just open the door?

430
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:55,239
Are you kidding me?
- Why? It's just a standard flip slide ball.

431
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:57,658
What are you doing?

432
00:31:57,742 --> 00:31:59,911
Well I can't...
- What? You can't what?

433
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:07,459
I can't fly!

434
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:12,047
You couldn't tell me before now!
It didn't matter before now.

435
00:32:15,676 --> 00:32:17,093
I hate you.

436
00:32:20,097 --> 00:32:21,932
There is something else I need to know?
- Yes!

437
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:24,225
I can't fly, I pick my beak and
once in a while I pee in the bird bath.

438
00:32:24,268 --> 00:32:25,852
Happy?

439
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:26,686
There, they are!

440
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:27,854
We got to get out of here!

441
00:32:31,774 --> 00:32:33,146
Wait. Listen to me.

442
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,732
Flying may not be my thing,
but walking is. Follow my lead.

443
00:32:35,737 --> 00:32:37,906
Inside right, outside left.
- Okay, I've got it.

444
00:32:38,072 --> 00:32:40,450
Inside, outside, inside, outside.

445
00:32:44,537 --> 00:32:45,914
Yes, yes! Come on!

446
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:57,467
See, I'm bilingual too.

447
00:33:01,888 --> 00:33:03,127
This is great!

448
00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:05,428
I'm chained to the only bird
in the world who can't fly!

449
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:07,873
Actually, there are 40 species
of flightless birds.

450
00:33:07,874 --> 00:33:09,187
Duck!
No, Ducks can fly!

451
00:33:09,229 --> 00:33:11,022
No! Duck!

452
00:33:31,897 --> 00:33:32,855
Oh yes!

453
00:33:43,284 --> 00:33:44,327
Yes!

454
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:45,371
Calm down!

455
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,687
Nooo!
NOoorrr!

456
00:34:01,905 --> 00:34:04,428
Get out of here, you putrid poultry.

457
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,345
Oh, what was that?
- A stick.

458
00:34:24,637 --> 00:34:27,305
Ahh, and that?
- It's just a rock.

459
00:34:30,788 --> 00:34:33,661
Is that a spider on your back?
- Will you quit it?

460
00:34:33,978 --> 00:34:36,439
It's just a leaf.
Turn around.

461
00:34:40,986 --> 00:34:41,945
Leaf.

462
00:34:41,986 --> 00:34:43,176
Told you.

463
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,489
Come on, we need to find
a safe place to spend the night.

464
00:34:46,492 --> 00:34:49,077
Safe? Safe!
We're in the jungle!

465
00:34:49,184 --> 00:34:51,100
You know when people say
it's a jungle out there,

466
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:53,227
I'm sure they don't mean it
as a good thing.

467
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:57,169
Look, I hate to break it to you but
this is where our kind naturally lives.

468
00:34:57,252 --> 00:35:00,713
Hey, don't talk to me about nature.
I watch Animal Planet.

469
00:35:00,755 --> 00:35:02,798
I know all about the food chain.

470
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,509
You see, out here
I'm just a hors d'oeuvre.

471
00:35:08,615 --> 00:35:10,804
Nothing more than a feathery spring roll.

472
00:35:10,828 --> 00:35:13,956
That is why we stay on the trees
and not on the ground.

473
00:35:14,102 --> 00:35:15,437
After you.

474
00:35:16,522 --> 00:35:18,210
Oh no, I don't think so.

475
00:35:18,961 --> 00:35:22,214
I'll feel much more comfortable
in something man-made.

476
00:35:24,424 --> 00:35:25,988
How about up there?

477
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:32,307
I can't believe I've to drag
your clumsy butt up there.

478
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:35,311
Drag me?
Watch and learn.

479
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:40,190
Blu! Just wait!

480
00:35:42,296 --> 00:35:44,346
Who's dragging who's butt now, huh?

481
00:35:44,347 --> 00:35:46,536
Ha, ha very funny.

482
00:35:54,183 --> 00:35:55,768
You see, who needs flying?

483
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:58,481
Birds, birds need flying.

484
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:01,735
Flying is... freedom

485
00:36:01,736 --> 00:36:04,598
and not having to rely on anyone.

486
00:36:05,528 --> 00:36:07,301
Don't you want that?

487
00:36:07,654 --> 00:36:09,907
I don't know.
Sounds a little lonely.

488
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:13,515
Let’s get some sleep.

489
00:36:14,536 --> 00:36:17,081
I'm probably going to be up
for a little while.

490
00:36:17,164 --> 00:36:19,582
Because I'm still on Minnesota's time.

491
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,210
Good night.

492
00:36:22,211 --> 00:36:23,713
Good night Jewel.

493
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,592
Good night Linda.

494
00:36:35,912 --> 00:36:39,352
Excuse me, sir.
Have you seen my bird?

495
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:42,335
Have you seen my bird?

496
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,612
Excuse me, have you seen my bird?

497
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:25,398
Have you seen my bird?

498
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:29,255
Lady, American lady.

499
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,175
Blu? Blu?

500
00:37:36,222 --> 00:37:39,641
I know where your birds are.
- You found Blu? Are you sure?

501
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:41,685
It's his.

502
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:42,864
Let me see that.

503
00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:50,151
You're right.

504
00:37:50,193 --> 00:37:51,925
Okay, where is he?

505
00:37:51,966 --> 00:37:54,219
Come on, let’s go.
I'll take you to him.

506
00:37:54,552 --> 00:37:57,617
No, no Linda, wait.
We don't know this boy.

507
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,099
We can't trust him.

508
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:04,673
I have to trust him.

509
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,071
I don't have a choice.

510
00:38:20,327 --> 00:38:22,935
Do you think I'm an idiot?

511
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:28,485
There were two birds,
chained together, in a cage.

512
00:38:28,492 --> 00:38:29,962
How could you lose them?

513
00:38:29,972 --> 00:38:32,913
They out smart us boss.
But don't worry.

514
00:38:32,923 --> 00:38:35,551
We'll get them back.
I have a plan.

515
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:37,616
Oh great.
What are you going to do?

516
00:38:37,637 --> 00:38:41,598
Wonder in the city, calling
"Here birdie-birdie, here birdie!"

517
00:38:41,641 --> 00:38:44,601
Well, anything sounds dumb
when you say it like that.

518
00:38:46,145 --> 00:38:48,813
We have to get birds to
the airport by tonight.

519
00:38:48,897 --> 00:38:51,817
But it's Carnival. All the roads
will be blocked by the parade.

520
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:55,007
That's why I wanted
to go this morning!

521
00:38:55,153 --> 00:38:56,175
Nigel!

522
00:38:56,781 --> 00:39:00,430
This bird is ten times smarter
than the two of you combined.

523
00:39:00,993 --> 00:39:04,225
If he's so smart why don't you
put him in charge?

524
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:06,331
I am putting him in charge.

525
00:39:07,749 --> 00:39:09,564
Stop suggesting things!

526
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:11,399
Go find them, Nigel.

527
00:39:20,282 --> 00:39:23,452
Hmm, if we can't get through the parade,

528
00:39:23,536 --> 00:39:25,413
we'll have to be in the parade.

529
00:39:25,434 --> 00:39:26,393
Huh?

530
00:39:30,252 --> 00:39:33,546
Are you sure it is going to work?
- Positive.

531
00:39:33,796 --> 00:39:35,171
Check my map.

532
00:39:35,881 --> 00:39:38,885
Yes, that's just comforting.
Thank you.

533
00:39:39,051 --> 00:39:41,470
Look, let’s just get this chain broken.

534
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:43,969
Right, then we can go find Linda.

535
00:39:43,971 --> 00:39:46,191
No, you can go find Linda.

536
00:39:46,204 --> 00:39:49,395
Once this chain is off,
I'm going back to being free in the jungle.

537
00:39:49,436 --> 00:39:51,147
Deal?
- Fine, deal.

538
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,572
Nice try Brainiac.

539
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:05,991
I think something is watching us.

540
00:40:11,354 --> 00:40:14,856
Oh, be careful Blu.
They might snuggle you to death.

541
00:40:16,443 --> 00:40:18,027
Oh, come here.

542
00:40:36,796 --> 00:40:38,380
Attack!

543
00:40:41,196 --> 00:40:43,240
What is going on down there?

544
00:40:44,386 --> 00:40:46,200
Go, go, go. Off with you.

545
00:40:46,242 --> 00:40:49,057
Okay guys, guys.
I told you a thousand times.

546
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,415
Manuela Sofia Kamana, listen to me.
Ow! O'yah, right in the eye.

547
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,355
Oh precious, ain't they?

548
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:57,253
The kids!
Seventeen of them and one on the way.

549
00:40:57,295 --> 00:41:00,507
Hey,... stop shaking them.

550
00:41:02,613 --> 00:41:04,785
They have given me great feathers.

551
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:07,287
Oh, this papa needs a break.

552
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,016
So, you two love birds
headed for Carnival?

553
00:41:10,183 --> 00:41:12,832
Wow, love birds?
- We're more like acquaintance birds.

554
00:41:12,842 --> 00:41:15,620
And not even that.
We're more like 'chained-together' birds.

555
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:17,190
Yes, I mean...
Ouch!

556
00:41:17,753 --> 00:41:20,134
What is it with these kids and the feathers?

557
00:41:20,135 --> 00:41:22,414
We have no idea, we're having them tested.

558
00:41:22,424 --> 00:41:27,492
So, do you think you could
help us get this thing off?

559
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:33,224
Lucky for you, you know Rafael,
and Rafael knows everyone.

560
00:41:33,268 --> 00:41:34,759
Ow! Again in the eye!

561
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:36,175
Okay, you want me
to call your mother!

562
00:41:36,176 --> 00:41:37,218
No!

563
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,775
Works every time.
They are scared to death of her.

564
00:41:39,785 --> 00:41:41,380
Call me for what?

565
00:41:41,735 --> 00:41:43,257
Eva, my love.

566
00:41:43,507 --> 00:41:45,631
I must take this young couple to see Luiz.

567
00:41:45,632 --> 00:41:46,717
Luiz?

568
00:41:46,844 --> 00:41:49,388
You don't fool me for a second.

569
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:52,496
You and your amigos just want
to sneak off to Carnival.

570
00:41:53,204 --> 00:41:54,758
Oh Carnival.

571
00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:59,086
That magical time when I met
the most beautiful bird in the world.

572
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:06,165
I still remember the song that was
playing when I first laid eyes on you.

573
00:42:06,384 --> 00:42:10,046
'Tall and tanning, young and lovely,'

574
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:13,913
'the girl from Ipanema goes walking.'

575
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:15,184
Come on baby, sing it.

576
00:42:15,185 --> 00:42:16,541
'And when she passes'

577
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:20,182
'Each one she passes goes 'Aah!"

578
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:24,548
Like a river of the sweetest honey.

579
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:27,050
I guess love is deaf too.

580
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,073
Come here, mmm.

581
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:36,039
Okay, take them to Luiz,
but hurry back.

582
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,706
You are an angel.

583
00:42:37,831 --> 00:42:39,876
I'll miss you, my juicy little mango.

584
00:42:40,084 --> 00:42:42,524
Oh me too. My pouchy papaya.

585
00:42:43,588 --> 00:42:46,924
Hey! Paco, Carlos!
Put your brother down, now!

586
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:48,925
I can't believe she actually let me go.

587
00:42:48,926 --> 00:42:51,075
So how far is this Luiz?

588
00:42:51,076 --> 00:42:54,028
Not far, 30 minutes says the crow flies.

589
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:56,600
And how long does the Macaw walks?

590
00:42:56,726 --> 00:42:58,568
Bobo here can't fly.

591
00:42:58,569 --> 00:43:00,445
But he's a bird.
- Not all birds fly.

592
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:02,560
There are Ostriches...
- You're not an Ostrich.

593
00:43:02,565 --> 00:43:04,051
Well, not technically.
- Wait, wait, wait...

594
00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:06,606
My friends, I want to help you,
but to walk the whole way,

595
00:43:06,607 --> 00:43:08,388
it... it can't be done!
- Where's daddy...?

596
00:43:08,393 --> 00:43:10,906
Daddy, daddy!

597
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:13,052
But hey, we might as
well give it a shot.

598
00:43:13,053 --> 00:43:14,118
Let's go, quickly.

599
00:43:14,123 --> 00:43:16,370
No, don't back.
They sense fear.

600
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,377
What an adorable monkey.

601
00:44:01,415 --> 00:44:03,145
Hey, my watch!

602
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,542
Hello boys.

603
00:44:30,552 --> 00:44:33,045
Seems like you had a busy day.

604
00:44:33,092 --> 00:44:34,358
Oh, what? This?

605
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:37,294
This is just some stuff we found.

606
00:44:37,304 --> 00:44:39,051
Right boys?

607
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:42,060
I'm not interested in
your nicked knickknacks.

608
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:44,957
Your burgle-bobbles bore me.

609
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,459
There are two blue Macaws out there.

610
00:44:47,794 --> 00:44:51,568
And I need your multitude
of vice to help me find them.

611
00:44:51,693 --> 00:44:54,550
Oh yes, what's in it for us?

612
00:44:55,051 --> 00:44:56,865
That's a fair question.

613
00:45:01,557 --> 00:45:03,163
Let's discuss it.

614
00:45:06,165 --> 00:45:08,021
I certainly see your point.

615
00:45:08,022 --> 00:45:10,765
But what could I possibly
do for you in return?

616
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,620
Save me, save me!

617
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:14,945
Oh, that's a thought.

618
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:16,404
This is enough?

619
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:18,627
I don't want to feel
like I'm cheating you.

620
00:45:19,324 --> 00:45:21,462
We'll do it, we'll do it.
Save me, please.

621
00:45:21,932 --> 00:45:24,246
Save me!

622
00:45:26,456 --> 00:45:29,042
Alright, you twisted my wing.
Deal.

623
00:45:29,803 --> 00:45:32,171
Now then, any more questions?

624
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:34,444
No? Good!

625
00:45:34,674 --> 00:45:38,490
You'll spread out and find these
Macaws by the end of the day.

626
00:45:38,491 --> 00:45:41,098
Or it's flying lessons for everyone!

627
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:42,350
Go!

628
00:45:44,704 --> 00:45:47,112
Go do your monkey business.

629
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,890
I changed my mind.

630
00:46:04,766 --> 00:46:07,153
Maybe we can find a bus
schedule or something.

631
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,364
Come on, you are not
going to back out now?

632
00:46:09,582 --> 00:46:11,543
Not in front of a lady.

633
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:15,411
Okay, yes..., sure.

634
00:46:15,516 --> 00:46:17,236
All right, that's the spirit.

635
00:46:17,237 --> 00:46:18,832
You sure you're up for this?

636
00:46:19,436 --> 00:46:23,204
I mean it's not like we're hurdling
ourselves off the mountain or something.

637
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:24,827
Right?

638
00:46:24,828 --> 00:46:27,226
Actually that was pretty
much my entire plan.

639
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:27,892
What?

640
00:46:27,902 --> 00:46:30,582
Don't worry Blu.
It's in your DNA.

641
00:46:30,585 --> 00:46:34,044
And if our featherless friends
can do it, how hard can it be?

642
00:46:36,484 --> 00:46:38,131
Help me!

643
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:39,956
Fun right?

644
00:46:39,957 --> 00:46:41,875
Yeah, fun.

645
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:44,910
Okay, I need you
two to get closer.

646
00:46:45,722 --> 00:46:46,973
Closer.

647
00:46:48,902 --> 00:46:50,581
Closer.

648
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,563
Nice.

649
00:46:53,564 --> 00:46:55,284
Now, put your wings
around each other.

650
00:46:55,285 --> 00:46:55,950
What?

651
00:46:55,952 --> 00:46:58,965
Come on amigos,
Not that she's going to bite.

652
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:01,321
Will you?
- We'll see.

653
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:04,742
Now, you flap your right wing
and you flap your left wing.

654
00:47:04,752 --> 00:47:06,952
And together, you fly.

655
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,622
This doesn't seem
aerodynamically possible.

656
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:13,334
You think too much.

657
00:47:13,339 --> 00:47:15,377
Flying is not what you think up here.

658
00:47:15,398 --> 00:47:17,806
It's what you feel in here.

659
00:47:17,811 --> 00:47:19,439
And when you feel the
rhythm of your heart.

660
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,299
It's like samba.

661
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:23,093
You fly.

662
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:29,599
See, it's easy.

663
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:30,741
Easy?

664
00:47:30,746 --> 00:47:34,917
Easy for you to say because
from here, it looks really hard.

665
00:47:35,188 --> 00:47:39,213
Hey, if want to see Linda again,
This is the only way.

666
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:41,381
Okay, you're right.
- Yes, I am.

667
00:47:41,423 --> 00:47:42,592
This is for Linda.
- Right.

668
00:47:42,675 --> 00:47:44,468
Keep it simple.
- Easy breezing.

669
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:46,845
Trust, lift, drag...
- Come on, let's go!

670
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:48,556
Wait!
Outside, inside, outside, inside...

671
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:50,599
Come on Blu, you can do it!

672
00:47:50,766 --> 00:47:52,643
I can do it, I can do it...

673
00:47:52,644 --> 00:47:54,312
I can't do it!

674
00:47:54,937 --> 00:47:56,272
Not again!

675
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:10,035
Am I dead?
- No, we are still alive!

676
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:24,467
This is incredible.

677
00:48:37,229 --> 00:48:39,731
This is the most beautiful
thing I ever seen.

678
00:48:40,565 --> 00:48:43,234
See what you've been missing?
- Yes.

679
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:52,910
Alright Blu, you're flying.
Sort of.

680
00:48:53,161 --> 00:48:55,288
Not really, but do you feel it?

681
00:48:55,297 --> 00:48:58,882
Yes, I do feel it.

682
00:49:11,993 --> 00:49:13,618
No, no, Blu!

683
00:49:14,933 --> 00:49:16,330
Mi Caramba!

684
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:27,007
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

685
00:49:28,112 --> 00:49:29,634
We're going to die!

686
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:01,228
You did not feel it in here.
- You think?

687
00:50:03,438 --> 00:50:05,191
Let's catch a ride to Luiz.

688
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:10,195
Hurry you two barbos!

689
00:50:11,821 --> 00:50:13,469
What's to the species here?

690
00:50:14,241 --> 00:50:15,180
Move it!

691
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,453
Come on love birds.

692
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,853
You made it.

693
00:50:22,082 --> 00:50:24,626
I would love to go five minutes
without getting killed.

694
00:50:24,751 --> 00:50:26,003
Is that too much to ask?

695
00:50:26,004 --> 00:50:29,131
For a bird who can't fly, yes.

696
00:50:34,511 --> 00:50:36,847
They're starting to close off
the streets for Carnival.

697
00:50:36,888 --> 00:50:39,746
Better be right kid because
we're running out of time.

698
00:50:52,404 --> 00:50:54,742
Never be able to get my
car through this crowd.

699
00:50:54,781 --> 00:50:56,366
Don't worry, I'm on it.

700
00:51:01,996 --> 00:51:03,723
Hey kid, where did you get this bike?

701
00:51:03,726 --> 00:51:05,876
I traded it for your jeep.
- What?

702
00:51:05,886 --> 00:51:08,524
Yes, it's in great condition.

703
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:11,944
Well, good condition.

704
00:51:12,298 --> 00:51:13,800
Hey, out of the way!

705
00:51:14,176 --> 00:51:15,238
Look out!

706
00:51:17,136 --> 00:51:18,346
Hold on!

707
00:51:32,944 --> 00:51:35,727
I'm going to chew through my own
leg if this doesn't come off soon.

708
00:51:35,738 --> 00:51:38,621
Relax, we find Luiz,
we're right where we want to be.

709
00:51:38,627 --> 00:51:42,781
Hey, Ralfie!
If it isn't the king of carnival.

710
00:51:42,787 --> 00:51:44,998
Nico, Pedro!
What a family?

711
00:51:45,164 --> 00:51:48,250
Where've you been hiding yourself bird?
I thought you were dead.

712
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,023
Hold up, rewind.

713
00:51:50,837 --> 00:51:52,546
Ain't that the bird from the cage?

714
00:51:52,556 --> 00:51:55,007
I think our love lesson when down smooth.

715
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:56,433
You work fast.

716
00:51:56,435 --> 00:51:57,687
Baby got beak.

717
00:51:57,693 --> 00:52:00,091
You're locked up and now
you're rolling with a hot wing.

718
00:52:00,092 --> 00:52:01,774
I want to be like you.

719
00:52:01,806 --> 00:52:04,371
Don't, it's not what you think.
We're just chained together.

720
00:52:04,381 --> 00:52:07,295
Hey, I'm not judging you.
Keep us spastic.

721
00:52:07,603 --> 00:52:09,772
Hey guys, we're looking for Luiz.
Have you seen him?

722
00:52:09,814 --> 00:52:11,502
Yes, I see him but you didn't.

723
00:52:11,505 --> 00:52:14,506
You just missed him. He took
the trolley back to the garage.

724
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,694
Oh great.

725
00:52:15,735 --> 00:52:18,196
Relax baby bird,
you can catch the next one.

726
00:52:18,363 --> 00:52:20,657
It's time to take it to the next level.

727
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,013
What's wrong with this level?

728
00:52:22,018 --> 00:52:24,787
Come on, this ain't the level.
Next level is the level.

729
00:52:24,828 --> 00:52:26,950
You got to shake your tail feather.
- Oh yes.

730
00:52:26,955 --> 00:52:30,104
We got to get this chain off.
- Come on love birds, you are in Rio.

731
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,565
You should enjoy it. Live a little.

732
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,671
We got them.

733
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,745
Welcome to paradise.

734
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,091
Some party, huh?

735
00:53:09,101 --> 00:53:11,250
This is the coolest place
I've ever seen.

736
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:13,543
Despite all the RVS health code violations.

737
00:53:14,565 --> 00:53:18,068
I like you.
Nothing you say makes any sense.

738
00:53:18,777 --> 00:53:20,279
Alright everyone listen up.

739
00:53:20,362 --> 00:53:23,062
Ralfi has some special
guests from out of town.

740
00:53:23,073 --> 00:53:27,244
Let’s show them some love because
I don't think they get out very much.

741
00:53:27,953 --> 00:53:31,456
Everybody put their wings together
and clap them as loud as you can.

742
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,772
Clap them, clap them.
I don't care, slap them.

743
00:53:36,003 --> 00:53:38,422
Party in Ipanema baby.

759
00:54:25,572 --> 00:54:28,388
What are you doing?
- I do not know.

760
00:54:29,785 --> 00:54:31,307
Alright, Blu.

761
00:54:33,497 --> 00:54:37,152

Hey, she likes you.
- What are you talking about?

764
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:46,530
Have you been listening?
- No, I've been watching.

765
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:48,950
Just be yourself, go on.

00:55:46,694 --> 00:55:48,488
You two are coming with me.

778
00:55:48,509 --> 00:55:50,678
In your little monkey dreams.

779
00:55:54,661 --> 00:55:56,225
That was meant for you.

780
00:55:57,059 --> 00:55:59,613
Come on, can we all get along?

781
00:55:59,727 --> 00:56:02,207
This isn't your fight big nose.

782
00:56:03,106 --> 00:56:06,151
You mess with my friend,
you mess with me!

783
00:56:06,192 --> 00:56:07,465
And us!

784
00:56:07,528 --> 00:56:09,696
Yes, little King Kong.

785
00:56:18,162 --> 00:56:19,915
I don't know what's going on here.

786
00:56:19,957 --> 00:56:22,946
Birds vs. Monkeys!
Get them!

787
00:56:28,465 --> 00:56:30,828
Yipee-kay-yay mountain man!

788
00:56:47,088 --> 00:56:48,276
Miss!

789
00:56:52,593 --> 00:56:53,927
We have to go!

790
00:56:55,471 --> 00:56:56,993
Need a lift?

791
00:57:09,547 --> 00:57:12,217
Take that you, funky monkey.

792
00:57:17,805 --> 00:57:19,578
Thank you!
- Any time!

793
00:57:19,662 --> 00:57:21,016
That's what I'm talking about.

794
00:57:21,058 --> 00:57:22,764
Bird man, we threw down!

795
00:57:22,769 --> 00:57:23,978
Yes, we threw down.

796
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:25,897
You guys were like fire and ice.

797
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:26,658
Thunder and lightning.

798
00:57:26,668 --> 00:57:27,658
Hip and hop.

799
00:57:27,669 --> 00:57:29,108
Cheese and sprinkles.

800
00:57:30,443 --> 00:57:31,944
It's a Minnesota thing.

801
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:35,365
You see, nothing you say
makes any sense.

802
00:57:39,972 --> 00:57:41,808
Come on, follow me.

803
00:57:47,939 --> 00:57:48,982
What?

804
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,100
But, the birds were here.

805
00:57:53,111 --> 00:57:54,435
Yeah, sure they were, kid.

806
00:57:54,445 --> 00:57:56,808
I swear.
The birds were right here.

807
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,048
How do you know?

808
00:57:58,053 --> 00:58:02,402
Because I'm the one who took them.

809
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:05,034
You?
- I didn't want to hurt anybody.

810
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:07,031
I just needed the money.

811
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:10,399
Fernando, I trusted you.
- I know but...

812
00:58:12,338 --> 00:58:13,694
Oh man, that's good.

813
00:58:14,779 --> 00:58:16,050
Hey guys.

814
00:58:16,467 --> 00:58:17,792
What are you doing here?

815
00:58:17,802 --> 00:58:21,097
I just wanted to see if you
have any work for me.

816
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:24,975
Well, if you were here two hours
go, you could have helped us load...

817
00:58:25,142 --> 00:58:27,458
What? Shut up!

818
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:30,851
So, why are you guys
dressed for Carnival?

819
00:58:30,857 --> 00:58:33,975
No one will know us when we
smuggle these birds... Ouch!

820
00:58:33,985 --> 00:58:35,299
Shut up!

821
00:58:37,467 --> 00:58:38,759
We need a float.

822
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:39,866
Oh.

823
00:58:40,032 --> 00:58:41,325
A float!

824
00:58:41,408 --> 00:58:43,671
So you guys are going to the parade.
Can I come?

825
00:58:43,681 --> 00:58:46,330
I'm a great dancer.
- Can he come?

826
00:58:46,341 --> 00:58:48,999
Come on, please.
Three's better than two.

827
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:51,856
Fine. We got to hurry though.

828
00:58:52,023 --> 00:58:53,514
Wow, I almost forgot.

829
00:58:54,568 --> 00:58:57,257
Where did I put it?
I thought it was right here.

830
00:58:59,363 --> 00:59:00,636
There it is!

831
00:59:00,886 --> 00:59:02,054
Got it!

832
00:59:02,387 --> 00:59:03,618
Let's go.

833
00:59:04,244 --> 00:59:05,448
Hurry up, kid.

834
00:59:05,454 --> 00:59:08,644
Can he go on the plane with us too?
- Shut up.

835
00:59:09,832 --> 00:59:12,063
We can't let them get on the plane.

836
00:59:14,211 --> 00:59:16,819
You can ride a motorcycle, right?

837
00:59:17,882 --> 00:59:19,488
You insult me.

838
00:59:28,768 --> 00:59:31,604
No, I can't drive a motorcycle.

839
00:59:42,886 --> 00:59:45,534
It's just like riding a snowmobile.

840
01:00:03,969 --> 01:00:05,596
What happened?

841
01:00:05,971 --> 01:00:06,883
Papa?

842
01:00:06,888 --> 01:00:08,265
What happened?

843
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:14,375
Don't hurt me.

844
01:00:14,397 --> 01:00:16,294
Stop your chirping and talk to me!

845
01:00:16,336 --> 01:00:18,024
No, I don't know anything.

846
01:00:18,463 --> 01:00:20,778
When I go biting down your head,

847
01:00:20,779 --> 01:00:23,742
will it go pop or will it go crack?

848
01:00:24,344 --> 01:00:27,257
Where are the civilian birds?

849
01:00:27,258 --> 01:00:29,244
That means Blu by the way.

850
01:00:29,557 --> 01:00:31,579
They escaped, went to Luiz.

851
01:00:31,704 --> 01:00:33,040
Anything else?

852
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:35,146
They said you were very nice.

853
01:00:35,293 --> 01:00:36,564
Did they?

854
01:00:37,378 --> 01:00:38,628
Liar.

855
01:00:38,649 --> 01:00:40,422
And handsome too?

856
01:00:43,321 --> 01:00:46,324
Never send a monkey to do a bird's job.

857
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:10,577
Don't worry, I got it.

858
01:01:16,478 --> 01:01:19,127
There he goes. That's my boy.

859
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:25,039
Is it hot?
I think I'm sweating.

860
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:27,010
I don't think it was even biologically possible.

861
01:01:27,114 --> 01:01:29,074
Look
- Oh, wow.

862
01:01:29,282 --> 01:01:32,994
Yes, that's your boy, alright.
- Okay, so he needs a little help.

863
01:01:33,005 --> 01:01:34,444
Oh, let's give him some.

864
01:01:34,454 --> 01:01:35,977
Set the mood.

865
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:40,300
I'm on it.
I know how to set the Mood.

866
01:01:40,301 --> 01:01:41,305
Check it out.

* Take her, take her to the floor *
* Show her, show her how you roll *

869
01:01:47,676 --> 01:01:50,971
* Drop it, drop it, drop it low *
* Drop it low, drop drop it, drop it low *

870
01:01:51,013 --> 01:01:52,347
Wow, wow, wow!
What kind of mood is that?

871
01:01:52,389 --> 01:01:54,224
Pedro, Pedro.
A little too aggressively.

872
01:01:54,229 --> 01:01:57,228
I'm not hating on your creativity,
but I think I've got this one.

873
01:01:57,269 --> 01:01:58,541
Follow my lead.

874
01:02:05,695 --> 01:02:07,961
Now that's more like it.

* Wasn't really thinking, wasn't looking *

877
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:21,669
* Wasn't searching for an answer *

01:02:23,025 --> 01:02:26,382
* In the moonlight *

* When I saw you face *

880
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:36,432
Wow, what a beautiful sunset.
- Yes.

881
01:02:37,683 --> 01:02:39,019
Psst! Blu, down here.

882
01:02:40,103 --> 01:02:43,189
Tell her, you have beautiful eyes.

883
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:44,755
That's good, great idea.

884
01:02:45,732 --> 01:02:47,839
I have beautiful eyes.

885
01:02:49,446 --> 01:02:52,104
Yeah, okay, sure, they are nice.

886
01:02:52,114 --> 01:02:55,092
No! "Her eyes," her eyes"!

887
01:02:55,619 --> 01:02:56,597
Your eyes.

888
01:02:56,619 --> 01:02:58,360
Your eyes are great, not mine.

889
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:02,542
I mean mine are okay but yours,
I bet you can see right through them.

890
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:04,835
Blu!

891
01:03:06,421 --> 01:03:08,589
Just tell her how you feel.

892
01:03:09,464 --> 01:03:10,946
Jewel.
- Yes?

893
01:03:11,237 --> 01:03:14,350
I've been wanting to tell you, that I...

894
01:03:14,814 --> 01:03:16,304
that I... hoook!

895
01:03:17,097 --> 01:03:19,224
How sweet, you're getting choked up.

896
01:03:19,913 --> 01:03:21,330
You're choking!

897
01:03:21,352 --> 01:03:22,790
Okay! Alright!

898
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,282
Yap, that's my boy.

899
01:03:48,462 --> 01:03:52,799
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Luiz's garage.

900
01:03:57,012 --> 01:03:57,846
After you.

901
01:03:57,888 --> 01:03:59,825
No, no, you first.
- Please, I insist

902
01:04:04,979 --> 01:04:06,479
I guess this is it.

903
01:04:06,605 --> 01:04:09,003
Yes, quite an adventure.

904
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:11,610
End of the line
- Ah, yes.

905
01:04:11,692 --> 01:04:14,273
I guess things like these
don't happen in Tiny-sota.

906
01:04:14,279 --> 01:04:15,520
Tiny-sota?

907
01:04:15,531 --> 01:04:17,886
- Oh wait, Minnesota?
- Yes.

908
01:04:18,095 --> 01:04:20,149
That's very good.
That's very funny actually.

909
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:21,287
Luiz!

910
01:04:21,411 --> 01:04:22,912
Are you here, Luiz?

911
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:24,195
Hey Buddy.

912
01:04:24,205 --> 01:04:26,457
I got some friends
I want you to meet.

913
01:04:31,546 --> 01:04:33,589
Inside-outside-inside-outside..!

914
01:04:41,681 --> 01:04:44,601
I got you... good.

915
01:04:44,975 --> 01:04:46,018
What?

916
01:04:46,139 --> 01:04:48,091
I could have rip your throats out.

917
01:04:48,146 --> 01:04:49,355
But I didn't.

918
01:04:51,129 --> 01:04:52,567
But I could have.

919
01:04:52,568 --> 01:04:53,901
Hey Luiz!

920
01:04:54,026 --> 01:04:55,757
Stop scaring my friends.

921
01:04:55,944 --> 01:04:59,677
Hey Ralfi, come here!
Where have you been?

922
01:05:00,595 --> 01:05:01,763
You look good.

923
01:05:01,783 --> 01:05:04,954
Wait, wait.
Luiz is a bulldog?

924
01:05:05,174 --> 01:05:07,039
You got something against dogs?

925
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:09,459
I do when they're drooling on me.

926
01:05:10,209 --> 01:05:12,378
It's a medical condition.

927
01:05:12,388 --> 01:05:13,922
No, amigo.
We really need you.

928
01:05:13,932 --> 01:05:15,433
She's mean brother.

929
01:05:15,443 --> 01:05:18,864
Luiz come on, please.
We need your help.

930
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:24,223
I think I know what to do.

931
01:05:31,814 --> 01:05:36,465
Are you sure this is safe?
- Sure, there's nothing to it.

932
01:05:36,466 --> 01:05:39,936
Now if something goes wrong,
scream really loud.

933
01:05:39,942 --> 01:05:42,199
Because i can't hear
too good with this thing on.

934
01:05:42,929 --> 01:05:45,547
Hey Ralfi!
Get the switch, please!

935
01:05:45,557 --> 01:05:48,017
Don't worry.
It's a professional.

936
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:58,590
Try not to move. I can't really
see out of this thing either.

937
01:06:21,863 --> 01:06:23,969
Hey, where'd you go?

938
01:06:41,258 --> 01:06:42,446
Gross.

939
01:06:43,385 --> 01:06:44,719
But I'm free.

940
01:06:45,136 --> 01:06:46,930
Jewel, we are free!

941
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:48,390
Slimey, but free!

942
01:06:48,514 --> 01:06:50,808
Contaminated probably, but free.

943
01:06:50,819 --> 01:06:52,394
Can you believe it, finally.

944
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:56,147
Over.

945
01:06:56,774 --> 01:06:58,441
Oh yes!

946
01:07:00,068 --> 01:07:01,819
Come on guys, let's go!

947
01:07:02,237 --> 01:07:05,531
What are we standing around for.
It's Carnival!

948
01:07:19,962 --> 01:07:21,902
I know just how you feel.

949
01:07:22,631 --> 01:07:25,374
Watching them up there,
makes you want to chase them,

950
01:07:25,384 --> 01:07:29,305
grab them in your mouth
and bite their heads off.

951
01:07:32,766 --> 01:07:34,768
I'm just kidding, bro.

952
01:07:35,602 --> 01:07:37,229
Chasing them is plenty.

953
01:07:47,364 --> 01:07:51,077
I'm flying, just like a bird.

954
01:07:51,265 --> 01:07:53,016
Jewel, but you are a bird.

955
01:07:57,542 --> 01:08:00,022
Hey, where are you going?

956
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:03,277
Blu?

957
01:08:05,654 --> 01:08:07,113
Blu, What wrong?

958
01:08:07,614 --> 01:08:09,908
Nothing.
Everything is perfect.

959
01:08:10,075 --> 01:08:12,598
You be off to the rainforest.
I be back to Linda.

960
01:08:12,603 --> 01:08:14,287
Just like we planned.
- I...

961
01:08:14,292 --> 01:08:17,383
Hey birds! Stop yapping
and start flapping.

962
01:08:17,394 --> 01:08:18,791
Let's go!

963
01:08:18,958 --> 01:08:22,587
I guess I thought maybe...
- What, that you'll come to Minnesota?

964
01:08:23,171 --> 01:08:24,798
Great, I guess I make you a scarf.

965
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:27,467
No, that's not what I meant.

966
01:08:27,508 --> 01:08:30,699
Look Jewel, I can't spend
my life walking around

967
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,472
following you wherever you're going.

968
01:08:32,477 --> 01:08:34,849
Hey, it's not my fault
you can't fly.

969
01:08:37,019 --> 01:08:38,352
Awkward.

970
01:08:38,436 --> 01:08:39,666
Okay, okay.

971
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:42,815
You know what?
This is good, just clear the air.

972
01:08:42,856 --> 01:08:44,952
Just be completely honest
with each other.

973
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:47,690
You want honesty!
Fine, I can be honest.

974
01:08:47,696 --> 01:08:48,915
I don't belong here.

975
01:08:48,925 --> 01:08:51,861
In fact, I never wanted to
come here in the first place.

976
01:08:51,866 --> 01:08:55,140
And... and, you know what?

977
01:08:55,829 --> 01:08:57,496
I hate to Samba!

978
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:02,210
Hey, that's a little too far.

979
01:09:02,376 --> 01:09:04,400
Make the mean bird take it back.

980
01:09:04,462 --> 01:09:08,299
Yes, I said it. Every song
sounds exactly the same.

981
01:09:08,309 --> 01:09:11,927
Tiko-tako, yayaya,
Tiko-tako, yayaya. Urghhh.

982
01:09:12,574 --> 01:09:14,492
I'm tiko-tako out of here.

983
01:09:14,576 --> 01:09:17,204
Fine!
See you around Pet.

984
01:09:17,214 --> 01:09:18,637
No, no, no, come back!

985
01:09:18,643 --> 01:09:23,022
You belong together!
You're Juliet, Blu is Romeo.

986
01:09:23,043 --> 01:09:26,942
Sure, they both die in the end
but you get my point!

987
01:09:27,734 --> 01:09:31,051
Young love, always so melodramatic.

988
01:09:31,697 --> 01:09:34,345
Alright boys, go after her.

989
01:09:34,553 --> 01:09:35,466
Blu!

990
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:37,577
Come back here, come on!

991
01:09:38,537 --> 01:09:40,500
I'm ready for Carnival!

992
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:44,197
Who wants to ride on my... fruit?

993
01:09:45,022 --> 01:09:46,753
They left without me.

994
01:09:46,837 --> 01:09:48,464
I'm missed out.

995
01:09:54,846 --> 01:09:57,722
Jewel! Jewel! Wait up!

996
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:05,865
Going somewhere, pretty bird?

997
01:10:05,876 --> 01:10:06,565
Oh yes!

998
01:10:06,689 --> 01:10:09,442
I was on my way to
crawl your eyes out!

999
01:10:09,444 --> 01:10:10,799
Jewel!

1000
01:10:12,591 --> 01:10:14,197
Temper, temper.

1001
01:10:14,218 --> 01:10:17,742
Now come along my dear,
we are going to the parade.

1002
01:10:17,909 --> 01:10:21,350
Everybody loves the parade.

1003
01:10:21,976 --> 01:10:23,477
Let go of me!

1004
01:10:24,207 --> 01:10:25,813
Hey, get back here!

1005
01:10:26,876 --> 01:10:28,956
Nobody messes with a friend of Pedro.

1006
01:10:28,961 --> 01:10:32,324
Ain't happening! It's on! Come on!

1007
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:33,988
Did you see the talon on that guy?

1008
01:10:33,993 --> 01:10:34,988
Talon?

1009
01:10:35,113 --> 01:10:37,491
Maybe it's on, next time.

1010
01:10:37,492 --> 01:10:40,098
Ralfi, help, help!

1011
01:10:45,519 --> 01:10:47,980
Rafael, quit following me.

1012
01:10:48,105 --> 01:10:51,234
You're going in the wrong direction.
Isn't Carnival that way?

1013
01:10:51,483 --> 01:10:53,278
I'm not going to Carnival.

1014
01:10:53,528 --> 01:10:56,405
No, I'm going home.
- But I thought you loved Carnival.

1015
01:10:56,437 --> 01:10:59,471
I do, but I love my
family much more.

1016
01:10:59,617 --> 01:11:04,079
And that's a choice I made
with this, and not with this.

1017
01:11:04,831 --> 01:11:07,103
Blu! Blu! Hey Blu!
I was flying,

1018
01:11:07,104 --> 01:11:09,971
then I saw this big cockatoo
with big ninja talon.

1019
01:11:09,972 --> 01:11:12,025
This cockatoo was ugly.
Anyway to the point.

1020
01:11:12,047 --> 01:11:15,215
Then Jewel was there, and
he snatched Jewel up.

1021
01:11:15,216 --> 01:11:17,593
Then he was like, "You coming
with me you little princess?"

1022
01:11:17,614 --> 01:11:20,763
And Jewel was like, Pssh!, pssh!
"I'm no princess, leave me alone."

1023
01:11:20,784 --> 01:11:22,401
And I was like, "hey!".
Then he was like "what!"

1024
01:11:22,402 --> 01:11:24,173
Stop! Just tell me what happened.

1025
01:11:24,183 --> 01:11:25,392
He got Jewel.

1026
01:11:25,413 --> 01:11:27,081
And he's taking Jewel to the parade.

1027
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,521
This is all my fault.

1028
01:11:31,377 --> 01:11:32,712
Let's fly!

1029
01:11:34,922 --> 01:11:37,509
Carnival, here we come!

1030
01:11:38,969 --> 01:11:40,971
Hey dog, I'm flying back here.

1031
01:11:40,991 --> 01:11:43,056
You'll get wet on this flight!

1032
01:11:48,206 --> 01:11:51,439
Come on, come on, come on.
Where are these guys?

1033
01:11:58,592 --> 01:12:00,718
Yes, nice.

1034
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,012
Very nice.

1035
01:12:03,763 --> 01:12:04,806
Marcel!

1036
01:12:05,411 --> 01:12:06,579
Marcel!

1037
01:12:08,707 --> 01:12:10,270
Oh, boy.

1038
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:12,481
Bird, chicken.

1039
01:12:14,253 --> 01:12:16,089
Come on Fernando, dance.

1040
01:12:18,632 --> 01:12:19,758
Idiots.

1041
01:12:22,929 --> 01:12:24,158
Excuse me!

1042
01:12:25,327 --> 01:12:26,661
Coming through!

1043
01:12:26,891 --> 01:12:28,038
Watch your feet.

1044
01:12:28,058 --> 01:12:29,560
Oops, sorry.

1045
01:12:30,415 --> 01:12:32,364
Go ahead. Come in.

1046
01:12:32,813 --> 01:12:36,275
Wait, stop please.
Performers only.

1047
01:13:04,991 --> 01:13:06,221
Tulio?

1048
01:13:07,431 --> 01:13:09,349
Linda, I was just a...

1049
01:13:19,171 --> 01:13:21,341
I look ridiculous, don't I?

1050
01:13:21,342 --> 01:13:22,382
(Lionel Richie - Say You Say Me)

1051
01:13:22,383 --> 01:13:26,083
* Say you, say me *

1052
01:13:27,856 --> 01:13:30,150
* Say it for always *

1053
01:13:31,924 --> 01:13:33,904
* That's the way it should be *

1054
01:13:36,438 --> 01:13:37,710
Sorry.

1055
01:13:38,962 --> 01:13:41,089
The Parade!
It's about to start.

1056
01:13:41,235 --> 01:13:44,029
Ok, one Witch.
Go ahead.

1057
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:48,075
Okay, just follow my lead.
Act naturally.

1058
01:14:03,695 --> 01:14:04,820
Are you okay?

1059
01:14:04,946 --> 01:14:05,989
Come on.

1060
01:14:06,072 --> 01:14:07,511
Blu!

1061
01:14:08,449 --> 01:14:10,597
Blu!

1062
01:14:13,371 --> 01:14:17,061
Wait, no, no, no.
I'm looking for a blue bird.

1063
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:20,524
Birdo. What birdo?
Move it, move it...

1064
01:14:21,921 --> 01:14:23,505
Wait, what are you doing?

1065
01:14:23,516 --> 01:14:24,403
Tulio!

1066
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:26,550
Hey! Let me out!

1067
01:14:37,936 --> 01:14:39,209
Tulio!

1068
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:43,025
This is not good.
This is not good.

1069
01:14:43,192 --> 01:14:44,150
This is...

1070
01:14:47,968 --> 01:14:51,388
Cheese and sprinkles.

1071
01:14:54,849 --> 01:14:58,249
Okay, you can put me down now.
I think we are done here.

1072
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:09,113
I think they like my moves.

1073
01:15:09,384 --> 01:15:11,427
Hey, keep dancing my boy.

1074
01:15:16,516 --> 01:15:19,269
One down and one to go.

1075
01:15:19,395 --> 01:15:21,308
You'll never find him.

1076
01:15:21,314 --> 01:15:22,350
He's already gone.

1077
01:15:22,355 --> 01:15:24,753
Oh, I don't need to find him.

1078
01:15:24,983 --> 01:15:26,818
He'll find you.

1079
01:15:32,407 --> 01:15:34,055
This is the spit!

1080
01:15:35,869 --> 01:15:37,156
Yeah, baby.

1081
01:15:37,161 --> 01:15:39,289
Now I can get my freak on.

1082
01:15:39,665 --> 01:15:42,459
Luiz please, rescue first,
freak later.

1083
01:15:43,793 --> 01:15:46,296
Come on.
Out of my way, people!

1084
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:53,281
All right guys,
I'll fly ahead to look for Jewel.

1085
01:15:55,097 --> 01:15:56,536
Hello ladies.

1086
01:15:58,516 --> 01:16:00,748
There's the big nose, hold up!

1087
01:16:05,273 --> 01:16:06,420
What!

1088
01:16:07,568 --> 01:16:08,422
Linda!

1089
01:16:08,442 --> 01:16:09,590
Excuse me, excuse me.

1090
01:16:09,611 --> 01:16:10,716
Linda!

1091
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:14,240
Linda!

1092
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:18,973
Speak English!

1093
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:22,644
Linda, you got to shake your dooche.

1094
01:16:22,685 --> 01:16:25,877
No, I don't shake our dooche in Minnesota.

1095
01:16:28,795 --> 01:16:30,590
Hot dog coming through.

1096
01:16:34,072 --> 01:16:35,197
Blu!

1097
01:16:36,617 --> 01:16:37,658
Tulio!

1098
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:40,266
Tulio! I saw Blu!
- What?

1099
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,687
Hold on Blu!
I'm coming for you!

1100
01:16:51,047 --> 01:16:52,152
What a view.

1101
01:16:56,803 --> 01:16:57,846
Blu!

1102
01:16:58,472 --> 01:16:59,577
Blu!

1103
01:16:59,973 --> 01:17:01,078
Linda.

1104
01:17:01,308 --> 01:17:02,413
Linda?

1105
01:17:09,733 --> 01:17:12,673
Blu we found her.
She's on some weird chicken float.

1106
01:17:12,714 --> 01:17:13,799
Come on!

1107
01:17:16,427 --> 01:17:17,615
Let's go get Jewel.

1108
01:17:17,678 --> 01:17:20,493
Wait Blu!
Where are you going?

1109
01:17:35,737 --> 01:17:39,491
- I saw Blu. He's riding on a Bulldog.
- What?

1110
01:17:42,369 --> 01:17:43,871
There they are. That's the float.

1111
01:17:45,163 --> 01:17:47,603
That float is a crime in itself.

1112
01:18:02,097 --> 01:18:03,202
There he is!

1113
01:18:17,445 --> 01:18:19,260
Hey Jewel.
- Blu?

1114
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,547
I'm gonna to get you out of here.
- No.

1115
01:18:20,552 --> 01:18:23,576
No Blu, you can't be here.
You have to go. Nigel is...

1116
01:18:25,036 --> 01:18:26,913
Hello pretty bird.

1117
01:18:26,954 --> 01:18:30,520
So kind of you to join our little charade.

1118
01:18:30,531 --> 01:18:32,438
Oh come on.
You think I came alone.

1119
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:35,484
I got three of the roughest,
meanest, craziest birds

1120
01:18:35,485 --> 01:18:37,205
in all of Rio right behind me.

1121
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:40,573
You know that guys, we're saved!

1122
01:18:41,364 --> 01:18:43,054
I think he means us.

1123
01:18:44,846 --> 01:18:50,290
Love, it's such a powerful
and stupid thing.

1124
01:18:56,922 --> 01:19:00,112
Oh, yes.
Well done, Nigel.

1125
01:19:06,035 --> 01:19:07,328
Out of the way.

1126
01:19:08,037 --> 01:19:08,808
Sorry.

1127
01:19:08,829 --> 01:19:10,331
Wait, wait!

1128
01:19:11,771 --> 01:19:13,120
We actually made it!

1129
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:15,482
Hey Marcel, can we do it
again next year?

1130
01:19:15,502 --> 01:19:16,639
Please, please.

1131
01:19:16,649 --> 01:19:18,193
Right, next year too?

1132
01:19:19,903 --> 01:19:21,612
Wait, come back!

1133
01:19:27,661 --> 01:19:28,869
Get in!

1134
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:36,648
I don't know how I got up here,
but I'm never coming down!

1135
01:19:46,304 --> 01:19:47,742
Come on, kid.

1136
01:19:57,565 --> 01:19:59,483
I'm going to get you
guys out of here.

1137
01:20:00,068 --> 01:20:01,855
What do you think you're doing?
- Nothing.

1138
01:20:01,862 --> 01:20:03,565
You shouldn't have done that.

1139
01:20:03,571 --> 01:20:04,697
Come on.

1140
01:20:13,456 --> 01:20:15,979
Just forget him!
Get the birds!

1141
01:20:20,421 --> 01:20:22,109
They're getting away!

1142
01:20:23,216 --> 01:20:24,988
We'll see about that!

1143
01:20:28,971 --> 01:20:30,076
Watch out!

1144
01:20:36,186 --> 01:20:39,273
We did it boys!
Yes, we are the best.

1145
01:20:39,315 --> 01:20:41,922
Is that a float?

1146
01:20:42,484 --> 01:20:44,819
Look at the detail on that thing.

1147
01:20:44,824 --> 01:20:47,093
Pull up you idiot, pull up!

1148
01:20:59,751 --> 01:21:00,794
Blu!

1149
01:21:01,545 --> 01:21:02,651
Blu!

1150
01:21:04,172 --> 01:21:05,590
Oh Blu.

1151
01:21:23,859 --> 01:21:27,362
Sorry Eva, I'm not going
to be home for dinner.

1152
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:35,328
What are you doing?

1153
01:21:35,338 --> 01:21:37,830
I'm going to pop this
open like a soda can.

1154
01:21:46,673 --> 01:21:48,654
Now that's pop it!

1155
01:21:49,009 --> 01:21:50,969
Hurry, we got to help the others.

1156
01:21:51,052 --> 01:21:53,054
I'm a pretty bird,
I'm a pretty bird.

1157
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,473
I'm a pretty bird,
Pretty bird, I'm a pretty bird!

1158
01:21:57,017 --> 01:21:57,996
Come on!

1159
01:22:01,605 --> 01:22:02,626
I'm out!

1160
01:22:17,662 --> 01:22:19,184
Oh, the light!

1161
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:27,817
Go, go, go!

1162
01:22:28,088 --> 01:22:29,548
Freedom!

1163
01:22:36,138 --> 01:22:39,558
Come on, we need to get out!
- Wait, wait!

1164
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,147
It's okay.

1165
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:46,586
It's okay.

1166
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:49,235
We'll figure this out together.

1167
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:50,778
Right?

1168
01:22:53,761 --> 01:22:55,282
Let him go!

1169
01:22:58,472 --> 01:22:59,494
Jewel!

1170
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:00,829
My wing.

1171
01:23:01,017 --> 01:23:02,664
Oh, pity.

1172
01:23:02,684 --> 01:23:06,230
Now we have two
useless, flightless birds.

1173
01:23:13,008 --> 01:23:15,396
Not cool man, not cool!

1174
01:23:26,146 --> 01:23:27,730
We're going down!

1175
01:23:29,857 --> 01:23:32,548
Okay.
Rock, paper, scissors, - chute!

1176
01:23:33,695 --> 01:23:35,948
Hasta la vista, losers!

1177
01:23:36,656 --> 01:23:38,241
Wait for us!

1178
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:40,765
Cannonball!

1179
01:23:44,018 --> 01:23:45,040

1180
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:46,875
No!

1181
01:24:01,514 --> 01:24:05,268
Blu, you're crazy!
What are you doing?

1182
01:24:05,351 --> 01:24:06,958
I'm not going to let you go.

1183
01:24:06,978 --> 01:24:09,439
We're chained to each other birds, remember?

1184
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:30,897
Wow.

1185
01:24:31,909 --> 01:24:34,964
Blu, you're flying!
- Yes!

1186
01:24:35,735 --> 01:24:38,946
I'm flying, I'm really flying!
You're right.

1187
01:24:39,134 --> 01:24:42,159
I'm not an ostrich!
I'm not an ostrich!

1188
01:24:56,986 --> 01:24:58,529
Dad, look!

1189
01:25:03,492 --> 01:25:04,618
Idiots!

1190
01:25:11,626 --> 01:25:12,835
Linda!

1191
01:25:15,587 --> 01:25:16,608
Blu?

1192
01:25:17,235 --> 01:25:19,758
It's Blu!
Look Tulio is Blu!

1193
01:25:19,967 --> 01:25:23,303
And he's flying.
My Blu is flying.

1194
01:25:23,345 --> 01:25:24,742
He's flying!

1195
01:25:40,946 --> 01:25:43,260
Here, let me see.

1196
01:25:47,327 --> 01:25:49,621
Don't worry,
I'll take care of you.

1197
01:26:21,006 --> 01:26:23,384

01:29:09,898 --> 01:29:13,455
* Any fear in my soul I'm letting go *

1236
01:29:13,518 --> 01:29:17,165
* Anyone who ask I'll let them know *

1237
01:29:17,271 --> 01:29:20,845
* She's the one, she's the one, I'll say it loud *

1238
01:29:20,847 --> 01:29:24,541
* She's the one, she's the one, I'll say it proud *

1239
01:29:24,645 --> 01:29:28,390
* Ring the bell, ring the bell for the whole crowd *

1240
01:29:28,444 --> 01:29:34,169
* Ring the bell, ring the bell, I'm telling the world *

1241
01:29:34,172 --> 01:29:37,907
* That I've found the girl *

1242
01:29:37,941 --> 01:29:41,686
* The one I can live for *

1243
01:29:41,737 --> 01:29:45,341
* The one who deserves *

1244
01:29:45,351 --> 01:29:48,940
* To give all the heart *

1245
01:29:48,993 --> 01:29:52,751
* A reason to fly *

1246
01:29:52,781 --> 01:29:56,508
* The one I can live for *

1247
01:29:56,550 --> 01:30:01,728
* A reason for life *

1248
01:30:29,488 --> 01:30:33,253
* I'm telling the world *

1249
01:30:33,297 --> 01:30:37,107
* That I found the girl *

1250
01:30:37,128 --> 01:30:40,822
* The one I can live for *

1251
01:30:40,843 --> 01:30:44,486
* The one who deserves *

1252
01:30:44,517 --> 01:30:48,169
* To give all the heart *

1253
01:30:48,201 --> 01:30:51,886
* A reason to fly *

1254
01:30:51,898 --> 01:30:55,436
* The one I can live for *

1255
01:30:55,447 --> 01:31:00,740
* A reason for life *
